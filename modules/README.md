# Modules Readme
## Summary
These modules are designed to be printed on a single page to facilitate running at a convention. They are designed to be 'First Taste' sessions:
* Easily run within two hours
* Give players completely new to Shadowrun a 'first taste' of the game
* Have enough space in the time slot to answer new questions, explain mechanics, look up rules, etc. 

These modules do not conform to the usual Shadowrun style guide so as to fit them on a single page. They are formulaic and simplistic. This is intentional. 

Feel free to add new modules! If you need help moving an image, let an admin know before issuing a pull request.
