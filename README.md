# Disclaimer
All attempts were made to keep the contents current with the various errata, mission guides, etc. that Shadowrun Missions falls under. Specifically, @Hobbes (Tom#9588) mentioned that the pre-gen characters may not be up-to-date since the release of Stolen Goods. If you find any issues, please file them as issues here. Wherever possible we'll work with the original content creators to resolve them.
